        <div class="introText">Cock Blocker is a browser extension that uses machine learning to skip nudity on omegle, male and female. Machine learning isn't perfect so there is a manual override if it does get it wrong. The timeout and thresholds can be adjusted in the settings.<br><br>

            This extension was made my me (an originally 17 year old computer science student, now 19!). Omegle can be a great place to talk to random people and I liked it for that, however there were way too many penises that I had to skip through to speak to normal people, so I decided to make this to make the experience better. It took a few weeks to design and create, and a few months prior of browsing the source code of omegle to see what did what and to learn about the web technologies it uses. 
            <br><br>This was initially made in the coronavirus lockdown period.<br><br>

            <br>
            This works by processing images and giving them a "nudity score" from -100 to 100 (if everything works as it should).
            <br><br>
            When the score goes over a Threshold, it will activate the setting, all thresholds can be adjusted in the settings.
            <br><br>
            If you want to manually confirm that someone isn't *in the nude* you can click on their video or the button to say so, this will make them not be skipped
            <br><br>
            If someone is going to be automatically skipped, there will be a bar above their video which goes down to indicate when they are going to be skipped
